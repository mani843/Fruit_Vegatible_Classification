## Image Classification Deep Learning Neural Network Model

The project involves classification of image into name of Fruit or Vegetable. 
Data set used is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritikseth/fruit-and-vegetable-image-recognition
Pre Processing of data of Fruits and Vegetables, Reading Image data set from folders to Array in TensorFlow, Building Deep learning Neural network Model with Multiple Layers of Sequential Model, Training the model, evaluating the Model and finally deploying Deep Learning Neural Network model of Image classification is carried out 
The Deep learning neural network model can be used in real time to classify any kind of images.
